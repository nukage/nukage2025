# Tailwind Group Block Project Planning

## Project Overview
Create a custom group block that integrates Tailwind CSS while maintaining compatibility with WordPress core block controls.

## Core Requirements

### Block Structure
- Create a custom group block named [tw-group](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/nukag/Local%20Sites/nukageredesign/app/public/wp-content/themes/nukage2025/resources/blocks/tw-group:0:0-0:0)
- Maintain compatibility with existing group block controls
- Ensure real-time visual updates in both editor and frontend views

### Key Features
1. **Control System**
   - Border controls
   - Padding/margin controls
   - Background controls
   - Typography controls
   - Layout controls

2. **Tailwind Integration**
   - Generate Tailwind classes instead of inline styles
   - Support responsive design through Tailwind's responsive prefixes
   - Maintain WordPress's visual editor experience

## Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: Custom Block Extension
- Create a new block that extends the core group block
- Override rendering to use Tailwind classes
- Maintain core block controls but modify their output
- Pros:
  - Clean separation from core functionality
  - Easier maintenance
  - Clear upgrade path
- Cons:
  - Duplicate controls in the UI
  - Slightly more complex initial setup

### Option 2: Core Block Modification
- Modify the existing group block controls
- Replace inline styles with Tailwind classes
- Pros:
  - Single set of controls
  - Simpler UI
- Cons:
  - More complex to maintain
  - Potential conflicts with core updates
  - Harder to revert

### Recommended Approach
Start with Option 1 (Custom Block Extension) because:
- It's less invasive to WordPress core
- Easier to maintain and update
- Provides a clear migration path
- Reduces potential conflicts with core updates

## Technical Considerations

### Control System Architecture
1. **Control Mapping**
   - Map WordPress control values to Tailwind utilities
   - Create a transformation layer between WordPress values and Tailwind classes
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     {
       padding: {
         small: 'p-2',
         medium: 'p-4',
         large: 'p-8'
       },
       border: {
         thin: 'border border-gray-300',
         thick: 'border-2 border-gray-400'
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Use WordPress block editor's onChange handlers
   - Implement debounced updates for better performance
   - Ensure changes reflect immediately in both editor and preview

### Transformations
1. **Core Block Migration**
   - Implement transformFrom/to for easy migration
   - Preserve content structure during transformation
   - Handle edge cases (nested blocks, custom attributes)

2. **Block Variations**
   - Create variations for common use cases
   - Provide presets for common Tailwind patterns
   - Allow customization through block settings

## Development Phases
### Phase 1: Core Block Setup
- Set up basic block structure
- Implement basic control system
- Test basic functionality
- Define the mapping between WordPress controls and Tailwind classes.
- Integrate Tailwind CSS into the block.
- Ensure the block automatically uses the Tailwind classes generated by the existing theme.json-to-Tailwind project.


### Phase 2: Tailwind Integration & Theme.json Integration
### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add block variations
- Implement transforms
- Add documentation
- Set up basic block structure
- Implement basic control system

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- Performance testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Accessibility testing
- Optimization of class generation

## Future Considerations
- Support for additional Tailwind plugins
- Integration with other custom blocks
- Theme-specific utility classes
- Advanced responsive design features
- Performance optimizations

## Documentation Needs
- Developer documentation
- User documentation
- Block usage examples
- Migration guide from core group block

## Integration with Theme.json to Tailwind CSS Project
- This project should integrate with an existing project that automatically turns the values from theme.json used for things like margin, font size, etc into tailwind classes.
